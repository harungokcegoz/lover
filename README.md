# General Info

Lover is an iOS application developed using Swift and UIKit that helps couples organize their daily tasks and activities. The primary objective of this project is to enhance my understanding of Swift programming and associated concepts.

As my first iOS app, it is simple and was created as a personal exercise.


# Features

## How Much Did You Miss Me:

Enter the date you last saw your partner and see the percentage of how much they missed you. While it may seem nonsensical, it was a local joke between my girlfriend and me, and I wanted to make her happy while learning.

## Romantic Quizzes:
Each launch of the app features 10 different questions from a prepared question pool. After completing the quiz, an alert displays with an unmerciful message based on the score.

#Conclusion
Throughout the development process, I aim to enhance my skills in Swift patterns/designs, data structures, optionals, structs, classes, networking, and Firebase integration. This project serves as a foundation for building proficiency in Swift and UIKit, preparing me for more complex projects in the future.

Lover is not only a practical application for couples but also a valuable learning experience for me as I continue to grow and develop as a Swift programmer.
